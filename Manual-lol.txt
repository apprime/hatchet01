The Router module automatically loads all files into the system om startup. Every controller becomes a valid extension to your URL. Beyond this point, every method inside the controller becomes a valid second extension and further parameters are split into an array and passed to the relevant method ((ie www.mydomain.com/{controller}/{action}/{param1}/{param2}).

By design, you must have a controller called 'index' and one called 'LoadError'. This can be altered in the Routing.js if need be.

The design also requires each controller to have one model with the same name in the Models folder. That model can then import other models as much as it wants.
